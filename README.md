# Code Louisville - Front End Web Development

This is my repository for the code I written for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course for September 2017. It includes a number of projects made from the Treehouse track for Code Louisville, as well as my class project, Incrementalism.

## Incrementalism

Incrementalism is a browser game in the clicker/incremental genre. You buy things with "units" that, in turn, make you more units. Powerful upgrades increase your income, and there's some hidden content.

### Installation

To install Incrementalism, just clone or download this repository and navigate to `/project/index.html` in your browser of choice. Alternatively, you can visit the live version at [www.akridgetech.com/incrementalism](http://www.akridgetech.com/incrementalism/).

## Treehouse Projects
For the Code Louisville class, a number of Treehouse courses were placed in a track and assigned by weeks. In this repository, code for most of the courses has been included.
