# Code Louisville - Front End Web Development

This is my repository for the code I written for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course for September 2017. It includes a number of projects made from the Treehouse track for Code Louisville, as well as my class project, Incrementalism.

## Incrementalism
Incrementalism has moved to [ChrisAkridge/Incrementalism](https://github.com/ChrisAkridge/Incrementalism).

## Treehouse Projects
For the Code Louisville class, a number of Treehouse courses were placed in a track and assigned by weeks. In this repository, code for most of the courses has been included.
